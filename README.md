sandbox character dress up thing prototype

Playtest Questionnaire
1. Anything that felt uncomfortable/ unintuitive in this prototype (aside from the lack of goal and context)?

2. Ok imagine this: if I were to link each clothing item to an audio track of a different instrument, and play different tunes based the clothing, as a character theme song generator, do you think it would make sense, or do you think it would be better if the character theme song generator is a separate thing?

3. Other comments/feedbacks?
